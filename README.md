I built a SaaS product in under 24 hours.

I took a challenge to build a SaaS product in under 24 hours or I would delete my social media accounts if I took more than that.

I built an URL-shortening bot. I built it because I believe URL-shortening bots are more useful than URL-shortening websites. The service gives you fast, cheap, unlimited URLs, No Ads, No Privacy issues (as you do not even have to log in :)). [Demo here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/harendra-shakya_24hourchallenge-saas-blockchain-activity-7021859696449912833-8_f0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).

Note: It's only website, telegram bot is private currently.

## Run

Finally, we will need to seed our database with the following command:

Run local host then
