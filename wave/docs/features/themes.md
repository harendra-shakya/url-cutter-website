# Themes

Our URL cutter bot is a powerful tool for managing and tracking links. It allows you to shorten, customize and track clicks and analytics with a user-friendly interface
In this section you will learn where the themes are located and how to activate a specific theme.

## Theme Location

Every theme is located inside of the `resources/views/themes` folder. When you install Wave there will only be 1 theme available, the `tailwind` theme. If you <a href="https://devdojo.com/wave#pro" target="_blank">Upgrade to a Pro account</a>, you will gain access to the Wave Pro repo, which currently has another theme available, the `tallstack` theme. Each theme is responsible for managing their own assets. In each theme you will find a `package.json` which contains the front-end dependencies to run webpack and build each one.

## Theme Assets

To compile a theme's assets you can navigate into the theme folder and run `npm install`, after you install the node dependencies you can run `npm run watch` to start your asset watcher and develop your theme. When you are ready to compile and minify your assets for production you will want to run `npm run production`.

## Activating Themes
